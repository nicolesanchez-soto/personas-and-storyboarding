                <h1>From Tap to Pour: Understanding User Interactions with Soda Dispensers</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="white-box">
                <p>It’s lunchtime at Andrews, and like many students, I find myself standing in line, cup in hand,
                    waiting for my
                    turn at the <b>Coca-Cola Freestyle</b> machine. The Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is a <b>widely used
                        public interface</b>, found in dining halls, restaurants, and fast-food
                    chains. What used to
                    be a simple, almost thoughtless
                    action—pressing a
                    lever to fill my cup—has transformed into a digital experience. Now, getting a drink means tapping
                    through a
                    glowing touchscreen, scrolling through an overwhelming number of flavor options, and waiting for the
                    machine to
                    process my choice.</p>

                <p>For some, this sleek, high-tech upgrade feels like progress—more variety, a modern interface, and
                    even a
                    satisfying vibration when you press the virtual button. For others, it’s just another barrier
                    between them and a
                    quick refreshment. As I inch forward in line, I can’t help but ask: <b>Is this machine making things
                        better, or
                        is it complicating something that never needed fixing?</b></p>

                <p>To find out, I observed and interviewed students using the machine. Was the interface intuitive? Did
                    it add
                    unnecessary steps? Did users enjoy the freedom of customization, or did they feel slowed down by an
                    excess of
                    choices? More importantly, <b>does this touchscreen-powered drink dispenser actually deliver on its
                        promise of
                        convenience?</b></p>

                <p>This case study explores those questions, unpacking how technology influences even the smallest
                    moments in our
                    daily lives. From user frustrations to design trade-offs, we’ll examine what happens when
                    customization meets
                    usability—and whether the Freestyle machine strikes the right balance.</p>

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p>Soda machines used to be simple—press your cup against a lever, and your drink poured out instantly.
                    The <b>Coca-Cola Freestyle machine</b>, however, reimagines this process with a high-tech approach,
                    offering
                    hundreds of drink combinations through a touchscreen interface. Instead of a few fixed options,
                    users now
                    <b>scroll, tap, and customize</b> their drinks, choosing flavors, caffeine levels, and calorie
                    preferences.
                </p>

                <p>At its core, the Freestyle machine aims to solve a problem of <b>variety and personalization</b>. No
                    longer
                    limited to whatever happens to be on tap, users can mix and match flavors to create a drink that
                    perfectly
                    suits their taste. But with greater customization comes <b>new interactions—and potential
                        friction</b>.
                    Instead of a quick selection, users must navigate a <b>touchscreen display</b>, browsing through
                    brands
                    and flavors, only to sometimes find their choice <b>grayed out</b> if it’s unavailable. Once a drink
                    is selected,
                    additional options appear, alongside a <b>calorie chart</b> in the top right corner displaying
                    nutritional
                    information. The large activation button in the center changes to show the chosen flavor’s logo and
                    alternates
                    with the text <b>“touch to pour”</b>. Unlike traditional machines, dispensing isn’t automatic—users
                    must tap
                    this button to start. Meanwhile, ice remains a separate process, controlled by a <b>mechanical
                        lever</b>.</p>

                <p>To streamline the experience, the interface includes <b>filter categories</b>—such as “low calorie”
                    and
                    “caffeine-free”—to help users find drinks faster. There’s even a <b>QR code</b> that allows mobile
                    interaction,
                    letting users pre-select their drinks. While these features promise a <b>personalized and modern</b>
                    soda
                    experience, they also pose a question: <b>Does this machine truly enhance convenience, or does it
                        overcomplicate
                        a task that used to be effortless?</b></p>

            </div>

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p>The Freestyle machine introduces new choices, but also new challenges. While its interface promises a
                    modern,
                    intuitive experience, the reality isn’t always so seamless. A well-designed system should make
                    interactions feel
                    effortless—but does this one? The best way to understand is to watch it in action.</p>

                <p>So, I stepped back and observed. How do users interact with the machine? Do they breeze through the
                    options, or do
                    they hesitate? What moments cause frustration? To dig deeper, I interviewed three
                    students—<b>Astrid, Kamryn, and
                        Simon</b>—to hear their thoughts firsthand.</p>

            <div class="white-box">
                <p>As I wait in line at the soda machine, I started noticing the little moments—someone hesitating
                    before tapping a drink,
                    a quick glance around to check if others were struggling, the inevitable sigh when the ice ran out
                    yet again. The
                    <b>Coca-Cola Freestyle</b> machine promises customization, but does it actually make the experience
                    easier?
                </p>

                <p>To find out, I observed and interviewed three students—<b>Astrid, Kamryn, and Simon</b>—as they used
                    the machine.
                    Each had a different approach, a unique rhythm in how they navigated the interface. Some moved with
                    confidence,
                    knowing exactly what they wanted. Others paused, scanning the options, sometimes backtracking when a
                    flavor was out
                    of stock.</p>

                <p>Across these interactions, patterns emerged. Small design choices—some intuitive, others
                    frustrating—shaped the
                    experience in ways that weren’t always obvious at first. Here’s what I noticed.</p>

                    <ul class="key-observations">
                        <li>All three users had a clear idea of what drink they wanted before approaching the machine,
                            indicating a pre-existing
                            preference rather than browsing options.

                        </li>
                        <li>Users typically started by getting ice, but a frequent frustration was the machine running
                            out of ice and showing no indication, leading some to wait for ice out of confusion.</li>
                        <li>The touchscreen interface was generally responsive and well-received, though one user noted
                            concerns about its long-term
                            performance based on prior experience with older models.</li>
                        <li>Users found the brand logos and drink categories easy to navigate, but some were frustrated
                            when flavors were out of
                            stock, requiring extra steps to find an alternative.
                        </li>
                        <li>A common point of confusion was distinguishing between the ice dispenser and drink
                            dispenser, especially for users
                            familiar with traditional push-lever machines.</li>
                        <li>Some users had to pause or backtrack due to mistaken selections, particularly because
                            similar drink variations (e.g.,
                            different Minute Maid flavors) were grouped in a way that could be visually confusing.</li>
                        <li>Users mentioned that the machine was generally intuitive but required a small learning
                            curve, especially for first-time
                            users unfamiliar with digital soda dispensers.</li>
                        <li>The machine’s physical design may present accessibility challenges—shorter users might
                            struggle to reach higher buttons,
                            and colorblind users might find it difficult to differentiate grayed-out (unavailable)
                            options.</li>
                        <li>
                            Some users found the touchscreen too bright, especially when standing close to it, which
                            could be uncomfortable in
                            certain lighting conditions.</li>

                            <p><b>1. How do you typically use the soda machine?</b>
                                All three knew their drink beforehand. Astrid and Kamryn grabbed ice first, then
                                selected their drink,
                                while Simon skipped ice and went straight to his Aha sparkling water.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>2. What were your expectations before using the machine?</b>
                                They expected <b>slower touch response</b> but were surprised by its speed. Simon
                                assumed
                                drinks would pour
                                immediately after selection.

                                Astrid was frustrated by <b>ice spilling unpredictably</b>. Kamryn liked the

                                    feedback</b>, and Simon
                                found the <b>separate physical pour button</b> unnecessary.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>4. How straightforward is the process of selecting a drink?</b>
                                Brand logos made navigation easy, but <b>out-of-stock flavors</b> caused extra steps.
                                Simon
                                found the

                            <p><b>5. Were there any moments of confusion?</b>
                                Simon struggled the first time with <b>ice dispensing and pouring</b>. Kamryn noted that
                                new users might try
                                pressing their cup against the machine, like with manual dispensers.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>6. Have you ever found yourself making an unintended selection?"</b>
                                Astrid sometimes misclicked due to <b>similar branding</b>. Kamryn noticed leftover
                                liquid

                            </p>

                            <p><b>10. What differences do you notice between this and manual dispensers?</b>
                                <b>Manual dispensers are faster</b>, but the Freestyle machine offers <b>more
                                    variety</b>.
                                Kamryn also noted
                                that <b>manual dispensers feel more hygienic</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>11. Have you seen others struggle?</b>
                                <b>Ice issues</b> were common. Simon saw users <b>repeatedly pressing buttons</b>,
                                thinking it
                                would speed things up.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>12. What could improve the experience?</b>
                                Astrid suggested a <b>hybrid dispensing option</b> like traditional machines. Kamryn
                                wanted
                                <b>better drink
                                    organization</b>, and Simon felt the <b>pour button should be on-screen</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>13. Do you prefer this over manual dispensers?</b>
                                Astrid prefers manual <b>dispensers for speed</b>. Kamryn likes the <b>variety</b>.
                                Simon
                                finds it <b>less
                                    efficient but appreciates the selection</b>.

                <p>With our observations and interviews complete, we now have a clearer picture of how users interact
                    with the
                    interface—where they struggle, what they appreciate, and the patterns in their behavior. But raw
                    observations alone
                    don’t tell the full story. To bridge the gap between individual user experiences and broader design
                    insights, we turn to
                    <b>personas</b>.

                    Personas help us distill our findings into representative user archetypes, capturing their
                    goals, frustrations, and
                    expectations in a structured way. By creating empathy maps, we can visualize not just what users
                    do, but also what they
                    think, feel, and say while engaging with the interface. This step moves us from data collection
                    to deeper understanding,
                    setting the stage for effective design improvements.

                <h2>Personas</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="white-box">

                <p>From our observations, two distinct user archetypes emerged: <b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b> and
                    <b>Exploratory
                        Lorie</b>. Each persona represents a different approach to using the Coca-Cola Freestyle
                    machine,
                    highlighting unique motivations, frustrations, and interactions with the interface.
                </p>



                <p><b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b> is busy student who values <b>efficiency above all else</b>. They
                    approach the machine with a
                    clear drink
                    preference, expecting a quick, seamless experience. When faced with unavailable flavors or the
                    extra steps of
                    digital selection, they grow impatient. Observations show that users like Taylor often pause or
                    express frustration when a desired flavor is unavailable.</p>


                <p>Users like <b>Exploratory Lorie</b> tend to <b>spend more time browsing flavors, showing engagement
                        with
                        the customization
                        options.</b> They like experimenting with
                    different flavors and
                    appreciate the
                    freedom of choice the machine provides. However, they often feel self-conscious when scrolling
                    through options
                    while others wait behind them, and they find the lack of certain flavors disappointing.</p>

                <p>These personas will guide our understanding of user needs, helping us design better interactions
                    that balance
                    both <b>efficiency and exploration</b>. Below is an annotated sketch that visually represents
                    their experiences.

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p> Now that we’ve got our personas, it’s time to <b>bring them to life.</b> Personas help us understand
                    different types of users,
                    but storyboarding lets us <b>see their experience play out step by step</b>. It’s one thing to say
                    that
                    someone values
                    efficiency—it’s another to actually map out what happens when they’re trying to grab a quick drink
                    and hit an unexpected
                    roadblock.

                    For this section, we’ll follow <b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b>, the kind of person <b>who knows exactly
                        what they
                        want</b> and expects to
                    get it <b>fast.</b> Taylor isn’t here to explore new flavors or debate between Cherry Coke and
                    Vanilla
                    Sprite—they just want to
                    fill their cup and move on. But the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine? It has other plans. Between extra
                    taps, out-of-stock
                    flavors, and an interface that demands more attention than a simple push lever, Taylor’s quick stop
                    at the soda machine
                    isn’t as smooth as they hoped.</p>

                <h2>Storyboard: Time Conscious Taylor's User Journey :)</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="white-box">

                This storyboard captures <b>Taylor’s journey from start to finish</b>, showing the little moments of
                frustration that add up
                when an interface gets in the way instead of making things easier. By walking through their experience,
                we can pinpoint
                where the design helps, where it slows things down, and how it could better serve users who <b>just want
                    to grab a drink
                    and go.</b>
            </div>

            <img src="storyboard.png" alt="Drawing of soda machine" class="intro-image">

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p>At first glance, the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine seems like a win—<b>hundreds of drink options, sleek
                        touchscreen
                        controls, and a modern interface</b>.
                    But for students like Taylor, who are in a rush, the reality is more complicated. <b>Ice shortages,
                        out-of-stock
                        flavors, and extra steps</b> can turn a simple
                    task into an unexpected hassle.</p>

                <p>From observing users like Astrid, Kamryn, and Simon, a clear pattern emerged: <b>people love the
                        variety, but
                        they
                        miss the speed and simplicity of traditional dispensers</b>.
                    Some, like Exploratory Lorie, enjoy the customization and are willing to take their time. Others,
                    like
                    Time-Conscious Taylor, just want to grab their drink and go. </p>

                <p>And that’s the trade-off: <b>more choices, but more friction</b>. Where a manual dispenser is
                    instant, the
                    Freestyle
                    machine requires extra steps—steps that might be exciting
                    for some but frustrating for others. For users unfamiliar with touchscreen interfaces, the learning
                    curve is
                    real,
                    while those in a hurry feel the pressure of the growing line behind them.</p>

                <p>So, does this machine actually improve the experience? <b>It depends on the user.</b> For those who
                    value
                    variety,
                    it’s a dream. For those short on time, it’s another roadblock.
                    The challenge now is designing an experience that <b>balances customization with
                        efficiency</b>—because
                    sometimes,
                    all people really want is a cold drink, <b>without the wait.</b></p>

                <h1>From Tap to Pour: Understanding User Interactions with Soda Dispensers</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="white-box">
                <p>It’s lunchtime at Andrews, and like many students, I find myself standing in line, cup in hand,
                    waiting for my turn
                    at the <b>Coca-Cola Freestyle</b> machine. What used to be a quick, mindless interaction with a
                    traditional lever
                    dispenser has now turned into something a little more… digital. The once simple act of filling a cup
                    now involves
                    navigating a bright touchscreen, selecting from a dizzying array of flavors, and waiting for the
                    machine to process
                    my choice.</p>

                <p>For some, this high-tech upgrade is a welcomed change—more choices, a sleek interface, and even a
                    little vibration
                    when you press the virtual button. For others, it’s just another thing that slows down the line. As
                    I inch forward,
                    I can’t help but wonder: <b>Is this interface actually making things easier, or is it an
                        overcomplicated solution to
                        a problem that never existed?</b></p>

                <p>To answer that, I observed and interviewed students using the machine, asking them about their
                    experience. Was it
                    intuitive? Did they run into any frustrations? And, perhaps most importantly, <b>does this
                        touchscreen-powered drink
                        dispenser live up to its promise of convenience?</b></p>

                <p>This case study dives into those questions, unpacking how technology is shaping even the most mundane
                    aspects of our
                    daily routines—like getting a drink between classes.</p>

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p>Soda machines used to be simple—press your cup against a lever, and your drink pours out instantly.
                    The <b>Coca-Cola
                        Freestyle machine</b>, however, takes a more high-tech approach, offering hundreds of drink
                    combinations through
                    a touchscreen interface. Instead of a handful of pre-set options, users can now <b>scroll, tap, and
                        customize</b>
                    their drinks with different flavors, caffeine levels, and calorie options.</p>
                <p>At its core, the machine is solving a problem of <b>variety and personalization</b>. Instead of being
                    limited to
                    whatever sodas are available on tap, users can mix and match to create a drink that suits their
                    exact preference.
                    But this level of customization also introduces <b>new interactions and potential friction</b>.
                    Users navigate a
                    <b>touchscreen display</b> to browse brands and flavors, tapping their selection, only to sometimes
                    find their
                    choice <b>grayed out</b> if it's unavailable. When drinks are selected, the options for different
                    flavors
                    appear,
                    along with a <b>calorie chart in the top right corner</b> displaying nutritional information. Once a
                    drink is
                    selected, the <b>middle button changes to display the logo of the chosen flavor</b> and alternates
                    with text
                    that
                    says <b>"touch to pour"</b>. This large activation button must be pressed to start dispensing.
                    Meanwhile, ice is
                    controlled separately via a <b>mechanical lever</b>.
                </p>
                <p>To streamline the experience, the interface includes <b>filter categories</b>—such as "low calorie"
                    and
                    "caffeine-free"—to help users find their preferred drinks more quickly. There's even a <b>QR
                        code</b> that allows
                    interaction with a mobile device. While these features aim to create a more <b>personalized and
                        modern</b> soda
                    experience, they also raise the question: <b>Does this machine make getting a drink easier, or does
                        it just slow
                        things down?</b></p>

                <h2>Recording Observations</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="white-box">
                <p>Standing in line at the soda machine, I couldn’t help but notice the small but telling
                    moments—hesitation before
                    tapping a drink, a quick glance around to see if others were struggling, the inevitable sigh when
                    the ice ran out
                    yet again.
                    The Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is supposed to make drink selection more customizable, but does it
                    actually make
                    things easier? To find out, I observed and interviewed three students—<b>Astrid, Kamryn, and
                        Simon</b>—as they used
                    the machine.
                    Each of them had their own approach, their own small frustrations, and their own way of navigating
                    the interface.
                    Some knew exactly what they wanted and moved with confidence, while others hesitated, scanning the
                    options and
                    backtracking when a flavor was out of stock.
                    Across these interactions, patterns started to emerge, revealing the small design choices that made
                    the experience
                    either seamless or slightly frustrating.
                    Here’s what I noticed.</p>

                    <ul class="key-observations">
                        <li>All three users had a clear idea of what drink they wanted before approaching the machine,
                            indicating a pre-existing
                            preference rather than browsing options.

                        </li>
                        <li>Users typically started by getting ice, but a frequent frustration was the machine running
                            out of ice and showing no indication, leading some to wait for ice out of confusion.</li>
                        <li>The touchscreen interface was generally responsive and well-received, though one user noted
                            concerns about its long-term
                            performance based on prior experience with older models.</li>
                        <li>Users found the brand logos and drink categories easy to navigate, but some were frustrated
                            when flavors were out of
                            stock, requiring extra steps to find an alternative.
                        </li>
                        <li>A common point of confusion was distinguishing between the ice dispenser and drink
                            dispenser, especially for users
                            familiar with traditional push-lever machines.</li>
                        <li>Some users had to pause or backtrack due to mistaken selections, particularly because
                            similar drink variations (e.g.,
                            different Minute Maid flavors) were grouped in a way that could be visually confusing.</li>
                        <li>Users mentioned that the machine was generally intuitive but required a small learning
                            curve, especially for first-time
                            users unfamiliar with digital soda dispensers.</li>
                        <li>The machine’s physical design may present accessibility challenges—shorter users might
                            struggle to reach higher buttons,
                            and colorblind users might find it difficult to differentiate grayed-out (unavailable)
                            options.</li>
                        <li>
                            Some users found the touchscreen too bright, especially when standing close to it, which
                            could be uncomfortable in
                            certain lighting conditions.</li>

                            <p><b>1. How do you typically use the soda machine?</b>
                                All three knew their drink beforehand. Astrid and Kamryn grabbed ice first, then
                                selected their drink,
                                while Simon skipped ice and went straight to his Aha sparkling water.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>2. What were your expectations before using the machine?</b>
                                They expected <b>slower touch response</b> but were surprised by its speed. Simon
                                assumed
                                drinks would pour
                                immediately after selection.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>3. Was anything surprising about the interface?</b>
                                Astrid was frustrated by <b>ice spilling unpredictably</b>. Kamryn liked the
                                <b>vibration
                                    feedback</b>, and Simon
                                found the <b>separate physical pour button</b> unnecessary.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>4. How easy is it to pick a drink?</b>
                                Brand logos made navigation easy, but <b>out-of-stock flavors</b> caused extra steps.
                                Simon
                                found the
                                <b>grouping of drinks confusing</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>5. Were there any moments of confusion?</b>
                                Simon struggled the first time with <b>ice dispensing and pouring</b>. Kamryn noted that
                                new users might try
                                pressing their cup against the machine, like with manual dispensers.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>6. Have you ever selected the wrong drink?</b>
                                Astrid sometimes misclicked due to <b>similar branding</b>. Kamryn noticed leftover
                                liquid
                                from previous
                                drinks could be misleading.

                        <div class="column">

                                The new machine was <b>fast</b>, but Astrid and Kamryn had dealt with <b>lag on older
                                    models</b>. Simon found the
                                <b>reset time between users annoying</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>8. How long does it take to get a drink?</b>
                                <b>About 30 seconds</b> once at the machine, but <b>waiting in line adds time</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>9. What’s the biggest frustration?</b>
                                </b> No indication when running out of ice</b> was a shared complaint. Kamryn found
                                <b>reselecting flavors
                                    annoying</b>, and Simon
                                mentioned <b>occasional screen freezes</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>10. How does this compare to manual dispensers?</b>
                                <b>Manual dispensers are faster</b>, but the Freestyle machine offers <b>more
                                    variety</b>.
                                Kamryn also noted
                                that <b>manual dispensers feel more hygienic</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>11. Have you seen others struggle?</b>
                                <b>Ice issues</b> were common. Simon saw users <b>repeatedly pressing buttons</b>,
                                thinking it
                                would speed things up.

                            <p><b>12. What could improve the experience?</b>
                                Astrid suggested a <b>hybrid dispensing option</b> like traditional machines. Kamryn

                <p>With our observations and interviews complete, we now have a clearer picture of how users interact
                    with the
                    interface—where they struggle, what they appreciate, and the patterns in their behavior. But raw
                    observations alone
                    don’t tell the full story. To bridge the gap between individual user experiences and broader design
                    insights, we turn to
                    <b>personas</b>.

                    Personas help us distill our findings into representative user archetypes, capturing their
                    goals, frustrations, and
                    expectations in a structured way. By creating empathy maps, we can visualize not just what users
                    do, but also what they
                    think, feel, and say while engaging with the interface. This step moves us from data collection
                    to deeper understanding,
                    setting the stage for effective design improvements.

            </div>
            <div class="white-box">

                <p>From our observations, two distinct user archetypes emerged: <b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b> and
                    <b>Exploratory
                        Lorie</b>. Each persona represents a different approach to using the Coca-Cola Freestyle
                    machine,
                    highlighting unique motivations, frustrations, and interactions with the interface.
                </p>



                <p><b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b> is busy student who values <b>efficiency above all else</b>. They
                    approach the machine with a
                    clear drink
                    preference, expecting a quick, seamless experience. When faced with unavailable flavors or the
                    extra steps of
                    digital selection, they grow impatient.</p>


                <p><b>Exploratory Lorie</b> enjoys <b>variety and customization</b>. They like experimenting with
                    different flavors and
                    appreciate the
                    freedom of choice the machine provides. However, they often feel self-conscious when scrolling
                    through options
                    while others wait behind them, and they find the lack of certain flavors disappointing.</p>

                <p>These personas will guide our understanding of user needs, helping us design better interactions
                    that balance
                    both <b>efficiency and exploration</b>. Below is an annotated sketch that visually represents
                    their experiences.

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p> Now that we’ve got our personas, it’s time to <b>bring them to life.</b> Personas help us understand
                    different types of users,
                    but storyboarding lets us <b>see their experience play out step by step</b>. It’s one thing to say
                    that
                    someone values
                    efficiency—it’s another to actually map out what happens when they’re trying to grab a quick drink
                    and hit an unexpected
                    roadblock.

                    For this section, we’ll follow <b>Time-Conscious Taylor</b>, the kind of person <b>who knows exactly
                        what they
                        want</b> and expects to
                    get it <b>fast.</b> Taylor isn’t here to explore new flavors or debate between Cherry Coke and
                    Vanilla
                    Sprite—they just want to
                    fill their cup and move on. But the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine? It has other plans. Between extra
                    taps, out-of-stock
                    flavors, and an interface that demands more attention than a simple push lever, Taylor’s quick stop
                    at the soda machine
                    isn’t as smooth as they hoped.</p>

                <h2>Storyboard: Time Conscious Taylor :)</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="white-box">

                This storyboard captures <b>Taylor’s journey from start to finish</b>, showing the little moments of
                frustration that add up
                when an interface gets in the way instead of making things easier. By walking through their experience,
                we can pinpoint
                where the design helps, where it slows things down, and how it could better serve users who <b>just want
                    to grab a drink
                    and go.</b>
            </div>

            <div class="transition-text">
                <p>At first glance, the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine seems like a win—<b>hundreds of drink options, sleek
                        touchscreen
                        controls, and a modern interface</b>.
                    But for students like Taylor, who are in a rush, the reality is more complicated. <b>Ice shortages,
                        out-of-stock
                        flavors, and extra steps</b> can turn a simple
                    task into an unexpected hassle.</p>

                <p>From observing users like Astrid, Kamryn, and Simon, a clear pattern emerged: <b>people love the
                        variety, but
                        they
                        miss the speed and simplicity of traditional dispensers</b>.
                    Some, like Exploratory Lorie, enjoy the customization and are willing to take their time. Others,
                    like
                    Time-Conscious Taylor, just want to grab their drink and go. </p>

                <p>And that’s the trade-off: <b>more choices, but more friction</b>. Where a manual dispenser is
                    instant, the
                    Freestyle
                    machine requires extra steps—steps that might be exciting
                    for some but frustrating for others. For users unfamiliar with touchscreen interfaces, the learning
                    curve is
                    real,
                    while those in a hurry feel the pressure of the growing line behind them.</p>

                <p>So, does this machine actually improve the experience? <b>It depends on the user.</b> For those who
                    value
                    variety,
                    it’s a dream. For those short on time, it’s another roadblock.
                    The challenge now is designing an experience that <b>balances customization with
                        efficiency</b>—because
                    sometimes,
                    all people really want is a cold drink, <b>without the wait.</b></p>
